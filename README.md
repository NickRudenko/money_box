Used achitecture is MVVM. It was selected because it require not a lot of time to implement, but it make all code more testable. Unit tests can be written later, but it is easy to cover ViewController and ViewModel by tests if MVVM architecture is selected, and all functionality does not depends on each other.

Dependencies: Dependencies were added with SPM(Swift Package Manager). It helps easier to manage added dependencies and it is easier to understand what happens when you debugging your code.
